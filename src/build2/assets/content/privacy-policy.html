    <h1><strong>Using Personal Information</strong></h1>
    <p>We use your personal Information to provide our services to you, which includes: offering products for sale, processing payments, shipping and fulfillment of your order, and keeping you up to date on new products, services, and offers.</p>

    <p>Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;), if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;), we process your personal information under the following lawful bases:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your consent;</li>
    <li>The performance of the contract between you and the Site;</li>
    <li>Compliance with our legal obligations;</li>
    <li>To protect your vital interests;</li>
    <li>To perform a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
