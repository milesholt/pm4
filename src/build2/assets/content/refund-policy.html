<p>We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.</p>

<p>To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@obscura.solutions">contact@obscura.solutions</a>.</p>

<h2>Damages and issues</h2>
<p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.</p>

<h2>Exchanges</h2>
<p>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.</p>

<h2>European Union 14 day cooling off period</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, if the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. As above, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>You’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 2 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>

<p>If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your return, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@obscura.solutions">contact@obscura.solutions</a>.</p>
